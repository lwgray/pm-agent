# Contributing to PM Agent

Welcome to PM Agent! We're excited you're interested in contributing. This guide will help you get started, whether you're fixing a typo or building a major feature.

## 🌟 First Time Contributing?

New to open source? PM Agent is a great place to start! Here's how:

### Quick Start for First-Timers

1. **Find a Good First Issue**
   - Look for issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/lwgray/pm-agent/labels/good%20first%20issue)
   - These are specifically chosen to be approachable for newcomers
   - Don't see one you like? Ask in discussions - we'll help you find something!

2. **Set Up Your Environment** (15 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Fork the repo on GitHub (click the Fork button)
   # Then clone your fork:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pm-agent.git
   cd pm-agent
   
   # Set up development environment
   ./scripts/dev-setup.sh  # This handles everything for you!
   ```

3. **Make Your First Contribution**
   - Start small: fix a typo, improve an error message, or add a test
   - Even tiny improvements are valuable!
   - Your first PR doesn't need to be perfect - we'll help you improve it

## 💻 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Docker (for running Planka locally)
- Git

### Detailed Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pm-agent.git
cd pm-agent

# 2. Add upstream remote (to stay updated)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lwgray/pm-agent.git

# 3. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 5. Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# 6. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# 7. Run tests to verify setup
pytest

# 8. Start PM Agent locally
./start.sh demo  # Runs with mock agents
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Update your fork
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Make changes and test
# ... edit files ...
pytest tests/  # Run tests
black src/     # Format code
flake8 src/    # Check style

# 4. Commit with conventional commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat(worker): add task retry logic"

# 5. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Open PR on GitHub
```

## 📋 Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with these additions:

```python
# Good: Clear, typed, documented
def assign_task(agent_id: str, task_id: str, priority: int = 1) -> TaskAssignment:
    """
    Assign a task to an agent with optional priority.
    
    Args:
        agent_id: Unique identifier of the agent
        task_id: Unique identifier of the task
        priority: Task priority (1-5, default 1)
        
    Returns:
        TaskAssignment object with assignment details
        
    Raises:
        AgentNotFoundError: If agent doesn't exist
        TaskNotFoundError: If task doesn't exist
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Bad: Unclear, untyped, undocumented
def assign(a, t, p=1):
    # assigns task
    pass
```

### Best Practices

1. **Type Hints**: Always use type hints for function arguments and returns
2. **Docstrings**: Every public function/class needs a docstring
3. **Error Handling**: Use specific exceptions, not generic ones
4. **Logging**: Use structured logging, not print statements
5. **Constants**: Define at module level in UPPER_CASE
6. **Tests**: Aim for 80% coverage, test edge cases

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:
```bash
# Good examples
git commit -m "feat(worker): add exponential backoff for retries"
git commit -m "fix(kanban): handle GitHub API rate limits"
git commit -m "docs(concepts): add MCP protocol explanation"

# Bad examples
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "WIP"
git commit -m "updates"
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_task_manager.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/unit/test_task_manager.py::test_assign_task

# Run only fast tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Writing Tests

```python
# Good test example
def test_agent_registration_with_valid_data():
    """Test that agents can register with valid data."""
    # Arrange
    agent_data = {
        "agent_id": "test-001",
        "name": "Test Agent",
        "skills": ["python", "testing"]
    }
    
    # Act
    result = agent_manager.register_agent(agent_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.success is True
    assert result.agent.id == "test-001"
    assert "python" in result.agent.skills

# Use fixtures for common setup
@pytest.fixture
def mock_agent():
    return Agent(
        id="test-001",
        name="Test Agent",
        skills=["python", "testing"]
    )
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/classes in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure code meets performance requirements

## 📚 Documentation

### When to Update Docs

Update documentation when you:
- Add a new feature
- Change existing behavior
- Fix a confusing part of the docs
- Add a new example or tutorial

### Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── concepts/        # Explanations of key concepts
├── how-to/         # Step-by-step guides
├── reference/      # API and configuration reference
├── tutorials/      # Learning-oriented content
└── templates/      # Templates for new docs
```

### Writing Good Documentation

```markdown
# Good: Clear, structured, helpful
## How to Configure GitHub Provider

To use GitHub as your kanban provider, follow these steps:

1. **Get a GitHub Token**
   - Go to Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Click "Generate new token"
   - Select scopes: `repo`, `project`

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export KANBAN_PROVIDER=github
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
   export GITHUB_PROJECT_URL=https://github.com/users/YOU/projects/1
   ```

3. **Verify Connection**
   ```bash
   python -m pm_agent verify-connection
   ```

# Bad: Vague, unstructured
## GitHub Setup
You need a token and project URL. Set them in the environment.
```
