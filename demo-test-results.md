## Test Date: 2025-06-18

### ✅ Demo Mode Test Successful

The PM Agent demo mode successfully demonstrated the following capabilities:

#### 1. System Startup
- PM Agent MCP server started successfully
- Mock workers (Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, QA Engineer) registered with the system
- All services connected via Docker network properly

#### 2. Task Assignment and Execution
Mock workers successfully:
- Registered with PM Agent using their unique profiles
- Requested tasks from the demo task pool
- Received appropriate tasks based on their skills
- Reported progress at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% milestones
- Completed tasks and requested new ones
- Shut down after completing 5 tasks each

#### 3. Sample Tasks Completed
- **Backend Developer**: 
  - "Create API endpoints"
  - "Optimize query performance"
  - Other backend-related tasks
  
- **Frontend Developer**:
  - "Build responsive UI"
  - "Implement user authentication"
  - Other frontend-related tasks

- **QA Engineer**:
  - Testing and quality assurance tasks

#### 4. Worker Behavior
Workers demonstrated realistic behavior:
- Taking breaks between tasks (2-4 seconds)
- Waiting when no tasks available
- Providing detailed progress updates
- Simulating git commits and API integration

### Issues Resolved
1. Fixed Docker volume mount issue (pm_agent_mcp_server.py → pm_agent_mcp_server_v2.py)
2. Fixed Anthropic client initialization (removed invalid 'proxies' parameter)
3. Resolved Docker networking issues with worker containers

### Next Steps
- Configure real GitHub/Linear credentials for production use
- Test with actual Claude workers
- Deploy visualization UI for monitoring
