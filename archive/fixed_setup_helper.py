# Manual Setup Instructions for Task Master Test Project

## Prerequisites
1. Planka server running on http://localhost:3333
2. MCP kanban server configured and running
3. Claude with MCP server access

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Check if project exists
Ask Claude: "List all projects on the kanban board"

### Step 2: Create project if needed
If "Task Master Test" doesn't exist, ask Claude:
"Create a new project called 'Task Master Test' on the kanban board"

### Step 3: Create test board
Ask Claude: "Create a board called 'Test Development Board' in the Task Master Test project"

### Step 4: Create test tasks
Ask Claude to create these tasks:

1. **Implement user authentication**
   - Description: Add OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub  
   - Priority: high
   - Labels: backend, security, oauth
   - Estimated: 16 hours

2. **Create dashboard UI**
   - Description: Design and implement analytics dashboard
   - Priority: medium  
   - Labels: frontend, react, ui/ux
   - Estimated: 24 hours

3. **Fix payment processing bug**
   - Description: Payments failing for international cards
   - Priority: urgent
   - Labels: backend, payments, bug
   - Estimated: 4 hours

4. **Add unit tests for API** 
   - Description: Increase test coverage to 80%
   - Priority: medium
   - Labels: testing, backend, quality
   - Estimated: 12 hours

5. **Optimize database queries**
   - Description: Improve query performance for reports
   - Priority: low
   - Labels: backend, database, performance  
   - Estimated: 8 hours

### Step 5: Verify setup
Ask Claude: "Show me all tasks in the Task Master Test project"

## Alternative: Use Claude Commands

You can ask Claude to run these exact commands:

```
# List projects
mcp_kanban_project_board_manager({"action": "get_projects", "page": 1, "perPage": 25})

# Create project (if needed)
mcp_kanban_project_board_manager({"action": "create_project", "name": "Task Master Test"})

# Get boards for project  
mcp_kanban_project_board_manager({"action": "get_boards", "projectId": "PROJECT_ID"})

# Create tasks
mcp_kanban_card_manager({"action": "create", "listId": "LIST_ID", "name": "Task Name", "description": "Task Description"})
```

## Testing the Setup

Once set up, you can test the PM agent integration by running:

```bash
cd /Users/lwgray/dev/pm-agent
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_real_kanban_integration.py -v -s
```

## Troubleshooting

If the setup doesn't work:

1. **Check MCP server status**: Make sure your kanban MCP server is running
2. **Check Planka connection**: Visit http://localhost:3333 and verify you can log in
3. **Check Claude MCP access**: Make sure Claude can see your MCP servers
4. **Manual verification**: Create the project manually in Planka web UI

## Next Steps

After setup is complete:
1. Run the integration tests
2. Test the PM agent functionality
3. Verify task assignment and status updates work
