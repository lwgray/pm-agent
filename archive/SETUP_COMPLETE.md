## âœ… Next Steps:

The test project is now ready! You can:

1. **Run the integration tests**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/lwgray/dev/pm-agent
   source venv/bin/activate  # if using virtual env
   python -m pytest tests/integration/test_real_kanban_integration.py -v -s
   ```

2. **Test the PM agent setup script** (should now work):
   ```bash
   python tests/setup_test_project.py
   ```

3. **Use the PM agent MCP server** with the test tasks

## Why the original setup script wasn't working:

1. **Missing pagination parameters** - The MCP kanban tools require `page` and `perPage` parameters
2. **API structure misunderstanding** - Some calls need specific IDs and parameter combinations
3. **Project/Board relationship** - The script needed to properly navigate the project â†’ board â†’ lists â†’ cards hierarchy

## ðŸŽ¯ The test environment is now ready for PM agent integration testing!

You can verify the setup by visiting your Planka instance at http://localhost:3333 and seeing the "Task Master Test" project with the "Test Development Board" containing 5 test tasks.
