## üîß **Technical Implementation Issues**

### 1. **MCP Integration Problems**
```python
# BROKEN: This API call will fail
cards = await self._call_tool("mcp_kanban_card_manager", {
    "action": "get_all",
    "boardId": self.board_id,
    "columnName": column  # This parameter doesn't exist!
})
```

### 2. **Missing Agent Registration System**
- No way for agents to register with their skills/capabilities
- `agent_status` dict is never populated
- Task assignment will always fail for unregistered agents

### 3. **Incomplete Monitoring Loop**
- Monitoring starts but has broken API calls
- Will crash when trying to get tasks by column
- No error handling for API failures

### 4. **No Persistence Layer**
- All state is in-memory only
- No database or file storage
- Data lost on restart

### 5. **Missing Production Features**
- No authentication/authorization
- No rate limiting
- No health checks
- No metrics collection
- No deployment configuration

## üéØ **Priority Fix List**

### **Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)**
1. **Fix MCP API calls** - Remove non-existent parameters
2. **Implement agent registration** - Allow agents to register skills
3. **Fix monitoring loop** - Make it actually work with real data
4. **Add basic error handling** - Prevent crashes

### **Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 2-4)**
1. **Real Slack integration** - Not just stubs
2. **Dependency tracking** - Actual dependency management
3. **Proactive monitoring** - Detect stalled tasks automatically
4. **Workload balancing** - Implement actual algorithms

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-8)**
1. **Learning systems** - Track performance and improve
2. **Calendar integration** - Real scheduling capabilities
3. **Advanced analytics** - Better risk assessment
4. **Production hardening** - Auth, monitoring, deployment

## üèÅ **Recommendation**

The codebase has a **solid foundation** but needs **significant development** before it meets PRD requirements. Key issues:

1. **Core functionality is broken** - API integration issues prevent basic operation
2. **Missing production features** - No real integrations, just stubs
3. **Incomplete workflows** - Many features are partially implemented
4. **No learning capabilities** - Static algorithms, no improvement over time

**Estimate:** **6-8 weeks of focused development** needed to reach 90% PRD compliance.

**Bottom Line:** Currently a **prototype/demo** level implementation that demonstrates concepts but is **not production-ready** as specified in the PRD.
