## üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Test Current State**
```bash
cd /Users/lwgray/dev/pm-agent
python test_mvp.py
```

### **Step 2: Fix Issues Found**
Based on test results, fix the most critical issues first:
1. MCP connection problems
2. API parameter mismatches  
3. Missing error handling

### **Step 3: Run MVP Server**
```bash
# Update your MCP config to include MVP server
# Add to ~/.config/claude-desktop/config.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pm-agent-mvp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/Users/lwgray/dev/pm-agent/pm_agent_mvp.py"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_ID": "pm_agent",
        "AGENT_TYPE": "project_manager"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Step 4: Test Through Claude**
Example conversation with Claude:
```
1. "Register a new agent with ID 'dev1', name 'Alice', role 'Backend Developer', skills ['python', 'fastapi']"

2. "Request next task for agent 'dev1'"

3. "Report progress for dev1 on task [ID] - status 'in_progress', progress 50, message 'Completed database schema'"

4. "Get current project status"
```

## üìä **MVP Success Metrics**

### **Technical Metrics**
- [ ] All MVP tools respond within 5 seconds
- [ ] Zero crashes during 1-hour test session
- [ ] Successful task assignment rate > 90%
- [ ] Kanban board updates correctly 100% of time

### **User Experience Metrics**
- [ ] Agent can complete full workflow without errors
- [ ] AI instructions are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Blocker resolution suggestions are relevant
- [ ] Project status provides useful information

### **Demo Readiness**
- [ ] Can demonstrate complete agent lifecycle
- [ ] Multiple agents can work simultaneously
- [ ] Real tasks are assigned from actual kanban board
- [ ] System recovers gracefully from errors

## üöß **Known Limitations of MVP**

### **What MVP Won't Do:**
1. **No Advanced AI** - Simple task selection, basic instructions
2. **No Real Integrations** - Kanban comments only, no Slack/email
3. **No Learning** - Static algorithms, no improvement over time
4. **No Complex Workflows** - Linear task assignment only
5. **No Monitoring** - Manual project status checks only

### **Acceptable for MVP:**
- Simple "next highest priority task" assignment
- Basic AI-generated instructions
- Manual blocker reporting (no auto-detection)
- Kanban-only communication
- In-memory state (lost on restart)

## üéØ **Post-MVP Roadmap (Weeks 4-12)**

### **Version 1.1 (Weeks 4-6): Smart Assignment**
- Skills-based task matching
- Workload balancing
- Dependency awareness

### **Version 1.2 (Weeks 7-9): Real Integrations**
- Slack notifications
- Email summaries
- Calendar integration

### **Version 1.3 (Weeks 10-12): Intelligence**
- Continuous monitoring
- Predictive analytics
- Learning algorithms

## üèÅ **MVP Definition of Done**

The MVP is complete when:

‚úÖ **Core Workflow Works:**
- Agent registers ‚Üí requests task ‚Üí gets assignment ‚Üí reports progress ‚Üí completes task

‚úÖ **Integration Works:**
- PM Agent runs as MCP server
- Claude can call all MVP tools
- Kanban board updates correctly

‚úÖ **AI Features Work:**
- Task instructions are generated
- Blocker resolutions are suggested
- Project status is analyzed

‚úÖ **Demo Ready:**
- Can show complete workflow to stakeholders
- Handles multiple agents simultaneously
- Provides clear business value

**Bottom Line:** MVP proves the core concept works and delivers immediate value, setting the foundation for the full system described in the PRD.
