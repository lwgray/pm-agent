## Privacy Protection Explained

### 🛡️ **How We Protect Your Data**

#### Anonymous from the Start
```
Your Project: "Update user authentication system"
What we see: [numerical pattern indicating task complexity level]

Your Team: "Alice (Senior Dev), Bob (Junior Dev), Carol (Designer)"
What we see: [role_diversity: 3, experience_mix: "mixed", size_bucket: "small"]
```

#### Statistical Noise Protection
We add random "noise" to all numbers so individual data points can't be identified:
```
Your actual velocity: 8.2 tasks/week
What gets transmitted: 8.7 tasks/week (with privacy noise)
```

#### Group Protection (K-Anonymity)
We only share insights that represent at least 5 similar users:
```
❌ "Only 2 teams use this pattern" → Not shared
✅ "15+ teams use this pattern" → Shared anonymously
```

#### Time Fuzzing
Exact timestamps are rounded to protect timing patterns:
```
Your actual: 2025-06-25 14:23:17
What we see: 2025-06-25 14:00:00 (rounded to hour)
```

### 🔍 **What We Can't See**

#### Never Collected:
- ❌ Actual task titles or descriptions
- ❌ Project names or client information
- ❌ Individual team member names or emails
- ❌ Specific dates or deadlines
- ❌ Budget or financial information
- ❌ Customer or stakeholder details
- ❌ Code, documents, or project artifacts
- ❌ Private messages or communications

#### Always Anonymized:
- ✅ Team size → "small/medium/large"
- ✅ Task count → "low/moderate/high"
- ✅ Timeline → "short/medium/long"
- ✅ Complexity → "simple/moderate/complex"
- ✅ Project ID → 8-character anonymous hash

## Making Your Decision

### 🤔 **Questions to Ask Yourself**

1. **"Do I want to help improve project management for everyone?"**
   - If yes → Consider enabling categories that provide industry insights

2. **"Do I want better predictions and recommendations for my team?"**

3. **"Is my project/team highly sensitive or confidential?"**
   - If yes → Start with just one category and see how it feels

4. **"Do I want to influence what features get built?"**
