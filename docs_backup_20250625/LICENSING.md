## Important: Planka AGPL Implications

If you use Planka with PM Agent:

1. **Local Use Only**: We strongly recommend using Planka ONLY for local deployments
2. **No Public Hosting**: Do NOT host Planka publicly without understanding AGPL requirements
3. **Source Code Sharing**: AGPL requires you to share the source code of your ENTIRE application (including PM Agent modifications) if you offer it as a network service
4. **Alternative Options**: Use GitHub or Linear for any remote/commercial deployments

## Deployment Recommendations

### For Remote/Public Hosting
```bash
# Use GitHub (recommended)
KANBAN_PROVIDER=github ./start.sh remote

# Or use Linear
KANBAN_PROVIDER=linear ./start.sh remote
```

### For Local Development
```bash
# Any provider is fine locally
./start.sh              # GitHub/Linear
./start.sh local-planka # Planka (local only)
```

## Compliance Checklist

- [ ] **Using GitHub/Linear?** You're good to go!

4. **Options**: Commercial users have GitHub/Linear, hobbyists can use Planka locally
