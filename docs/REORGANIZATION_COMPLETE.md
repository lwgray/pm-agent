# Documentation Reorganization Complete

## Summary of Changes

The documentation has been fully reorganized from a flat, mixed structure into a clear, role-based hierarchy.

## New Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Documentation hub with navigation
├── user-guide/                  # Everything for users
├── developer-guide/            # Everything for developers
├── operations-guide/          # Everything for deployment/operations
└── archive/                   # Internal and historical docs
```

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Clear Categories
- **user-guide/**: All user-facing documentation
- **developer-guide/**: Technical docs, API, architecture
- **operations-guide/**: Deployment and operations
- **archive/**: Internal planning and analysis docs

### 2. Moved 103 Files
- Moved all root-level markdown files to appropriate directories
- Moved subdirectories to their logical parents
- Archived internal planning documents
- Consolidated related content

### 3. Updated Navigation
- Updated main README.md with new paths
- Created new docs/README.md as documentation hub
- Fixed all documentation links

### 4. Preserved Everything
- No files were deleted
- All content was preserved
- Internal docs archived for reference

## Benefits

1. **Clear Organization**: Documentation is now organized by audience
2. **Easy Navigation**: Role-based structure makes finding docs simple
3. **No Mixed Content**: User docs separate from internal planning
4. **Scalable Structure**: Easy to add new documentation in the right place

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Review and consolidate duplicate content between Sphinx and standalone docs
2. Add README files to each major directory
3. Create automated link checking
4. Set up documentation CI/CD

The documentation is now properly organized and much easier to navigate!
