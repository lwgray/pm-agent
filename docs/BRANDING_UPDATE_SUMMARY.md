# Marcus Branding Update Summary

This document summarizes the branding changes made to the PM Agent documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Primary Documentation Files Updated
- **docs/installation.md** - Changed all references from "PM Agent" to "Marcus"
- **docs/sphinx/source/index.rst** - Already had Marcus branding (conf.py was correct)
- **docs/sphinx/source/conf.py** - Already correctly branded as Marcus
- **README.md** - Already updated to Marcus branding

### 2. Sphinx Documentation Updated
All files in `/docs/sphinx/source/` were updated including:
- getting_started.md
- installation.md
- quick_start.md
- configuration.md
- All user guide files (concepts.md, providers.md, etc.)
- All reference files (faq.md, troubleshooting.md, etc.)
- All developer documentation
- All tutorials and templates

### 3. General Documentation Updated
Updated all markdown and RST files in:
- `/docs/community/`
- `/docs/concepts/`
- `/docs/contributing/`
- `/docs/how-to/`
- `/docs/reference/`
- `/docs/templates/`

### 4. Email Address Updates
Changed support email from `support@pm-agent.ai` to `support@marcus.ai` in all documentation.

### 5. Docker Configuration
The docker-compose file has already been renamed to `docker-compose.marcus.yml` and contains proper Marcus branding.

## What Was Preserved

### Technical References Maintained
- GitHub repository URLs remain as `github.com/lwgray/pm-agent`
- Python module names remain as `pm_agent`
- Docker service names in technical contexts remain as `pm-agent`
- File paths and commands that reference the actual codebase structure

### Branding Consistency
- "PM Agent" → "Marcus" in all user-facing text
- "pm-agent" → "marcus" in user-facing contexts (but not in technical references)
- Maintained technical accuracy while updating branding

## Total Files Updated
Approximately 60+ documentation files were updated with the new Marcus branding while maintaining all technical accuracy and preserving necessary technical references.
