A live feed showing all agent activities, decisions, and communications as they happen. Accessible via the web UI at `http://localhost:8080`.

**How to Use It:**
- Open the Marcus visualization UI
- The main canvas shows nodes for each agent, Marcus (PM), and the Kanban board
- Animated message flows show real-time communications
- The event log at the bottom displays recent activities

**What Users Get:**
- **Immediate visibility** into what every agent is doing right now
- **Communication patterns** between agents and systems
- **Decision flow** from task request to assignment
- **Progress indicators** on each agent node

**Problem It Solves:**
- **Black box syndrome**: Without this, users have no idea what AI agents are doing
- **Trust issues**: Users can see agents aren't idle or stuck
- **Debugging difficulties**: When something goes wrong, you can trace the exact sequence of events
- **Coordination blindness**: See how agents interact and depend on each other

**Example Scenario:**
```
Worker 1 → Marcus: "Completed database schema implementation"
Marcus → Kanban: "Update task #123 to DONE"
Marcus → Worker 2: "You can now start API endpoints (depends on schema)"
```

### 2. Worker Status Dashboard

**What It Is:**
A real-time dashboard showing the status, workload, and performance of each registered agent.

**How to Use It:**
- Access via the metrics panel on the right side of the UI

    "3 tasks blocked for >2 hours",
    "Worker_1 success rate dropped 20%",
    "Database tasks creating bottleneck"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Prioritize database blocker resolution",
    "Consider adding database specialist agent",
    "Review worker_1's recent failures"
  ]
}
```

## Suggested Features (Proposed Enhancements)

### 1. Code Change Tracking

**What It Is:**
Direct integration between task completion and actual code changes, providing visibility into what code each agent produces.

**How It Would Work:**
- Automatic linking of git commits to task IDs
- Visual diff viewer in the task details
- Code metrics per agent (lines added/removed, files touched)
- Test coverage delta per task

**What Users Would Get:**
- **Code attribution**: Know exactly which agent wrote what code
- **Change scope**: Understand the size/complexity of each task
- **Quality metrics**: See test coverage impact of changes
- **Review facilitation**: Easy code review per task

**Problem It Solves:**
- **Code accountability**: Currently, users can't see what code agents actually produce
- **Quality blindness**: No visibility into code quality per agent
- **Review difficulty**: Hard to review code without task context
- **Impact assessment**: Can't see how changes affect the codebase

**Why It Needs to Be Part of Marcus:**
Marcus orchestrates code-writing agents, but currently treats code as a black box. This creates a disconnect between task management and actual deliverables. Users need to see not just "task completed" but "here's exactly what was built."

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
# Example integration
class CodeTracker:
    def link_commit_to_task(self, commit_sha: str, task_id: str):
        """Links git commits to Marcus tasks"""
        
    def get_task_changes(self, task_id: str) -> Dict:
        """Returns all code changes for a task"""
        return {
            "commits": [...],
            "files_changed": 15,
            "lines_added": 523,
            "lines_removed": 87,
            "test_coverage_delta": +5.2
        }
```

### 2. Quality Metrics Dashboard

**What It Is:**
Comprehensive quality tracking for code produced by AI agents, including build status, test results, and code review feedback.

**How It Would Work:**
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Real-time build/test status per agent
- Code quality scores (complexity, duplication, standards)
- Bug attribution to specific agents/tasks

**What Users Would Get:**
- **Quality visibility**: Know which agents produce reliable code
- **Failure patterns**: Identify common mistakes by agent
- **Improvement tracking**: See if agents get better over time
- **Trust building**: Confidence that AI code meets standards

**Problem It Solves:**
- **Quality anxiety**: Users worry AI agents write bad code
- **Hidden failures**: Build breaks aren't tied to agents
- **No learning**: Agents repeat mistakes without feedback
- **Standards enforcement**: No way to ensure code quality

**Why It Needs to Be Part of Marcus:**
Quality control is essential for production use. Without quality metrics, Marcus is just a task distributor. With them, it becomes a quality-assured development system that users can trust for real projects.

**Metrics to Track:**
```json
{
  "agent_metrics": {
    "worker_1": {
      "build_success_rate": 0.89,
      "test_pass_rate": 0.94,
      "code_review_score": 4.2,
      "bugs_introduced": 3,
      "bugs_fixed": 7,
      "code_smell_density": 0.05
    }
  },
  "task_quality": {
    "task_123": {
      "build_status": "passed",
      "tests_added": 15,
      "coverage_change": "+3.5%",
      "review_status": "approved",
      "complexity_score": "B"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Timeline Visualization

**What It Is:**
Gantt chart-style visualization showing task scheduling, dependencies, and actual vs. estimated timelines.

**How It Would Work:**
- Interactive timeline with drag-to-reschedule
- Critical path highlighting
- Milestone tracking and alerts
- Resource allocation view

**What Users Would Get:**
- **Schedule visibility**: See the full project timeline
- **Deadline tracking**: Know if project is on schedule
- **Resource planning**: Visualize agent allocation over time
- **What-if analysis**: See impact of changes to schedule

**Problem It Solves:**
- **Timeline blindness**: No current way to see project schedule
- **Deadline anxiety**: Users don't know if they'll finish on time
- **Resource conflicts**: Can't see when agents are overbooked
- **Planning inability**: No way to plan future work

**Why It Needs to Be Part of Marcus:**
Project management without timeline visualization is incomplete. Marcus makes micro-decisions well but users need macro-level timeline views to manage stakeholder expectations and plan releases.

**Timeline Features:**
- Task bars showing start/end dates
- Dependency arrows between tasks
- Agent swim lanes
- Milestone markers
- Today line with progress indication

### 4. Agent Learning Curve Analytics

**What It Is:**
Advanced analytics showing how AI agents improve (or degrade) over time, with skill development tracking.

**How It Would Work:**
- Performance trending per agent
- Skill acquisition detection
- Task complexity progression
- Failure analysis and learning

**What Users Would Get:**
- **Performance trends**: See if agents are improving
- **Skill development**: Track new capabilities
- **Optimal assignment**: Better task-agent matching
- **Training insights**: Know when agents need help

**Problem It Solves:**
- **Static capability assumption**: Agents' abilities change over time
- **Missed optimization**: Not leveraging agent improvements
- **Degradation blindness**: Not catching when agents get worse
- **Training gaps**: No data on what agents need to learn

**Why It Needs to Be Part of Marcus:**
AI agents learn and evolve. Marcus needs to track this evolution to make increasingly better assignments. This creates a virtuous cycle where both agents and project management improve together.

**Learning Metrics:**
```json
{
  "agent_evolution": {
    "worker_1": {
      "skill_progression": {
        "python": [0.7, 0.75, 0.82, 0.85],
        "react": [0.4, 0.5, 0.65, 0.73]
      },
      "complexity_handled": [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4],
      "learning_rate": 0.15,
      "recent_struggles": ["WebSocket implementation", "Redux patterns"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Natural Language Project Intelligence

**What It Is:**
Conversational interface for project insights, allowing natural language queries about project status and predictions.

**How It Would Work:**
- Chat interface in UI
- Context-aware responses about project
- Predictive analytics in plain English
- Actionable recommendations

**What Users Would Get:**
- **Instant answers**: "When will the API be ready?"
- **Clear explanations**: "Why is the project delayed?"
- **Predictions**: "What will likely block us next?"
- **Recommendations**: "How can we speed up delivery?"

**Problem It Solves:**
- **Dashboard overload**: Too many metrics to parse
- **Insight extraction**: Hard to derive meaning from data
- **Stakeholder communication**: Translating tech metrics to business language
- **Decision paralysis**: Too much data, not enough guidance

**Why It Needs to Be Part of Marcus:**
Marcus already has AI at its core. Adding natural language intelligence makes the vast amount of project data accessible to non-technical stakeholders and provides actionable insights beyond raw metrics.

**Example Interactions:**
```
User: "Why is the authentication feature taking so long?"
Marcus: "The authentication feature is 65% complete but blocked on two issues:
1. Worker_1 is waiting for database schema approval (3 hours)
2. OAuth integration tests are failing due to missing credentials
Estimated completion: 2 more days if blockers are resolved today."

User: "Which agent should I assign the payment integration to?"
Marcus: "I recommend Worker_3 (85% confidence) because:
- Previous success with Stripe integration
- Currently at 30% capacity
- No dependencies on their current tasks
Alternative: Worker_2 (60% confidence) has capacity but less payment experience."
```

## Summary

The core features provide essential visibility into AI agent orchestration, while the suggested features would transform Marcus from a task management system into a comprehensive AI-powered software delivery platform. Each feature solves specific, critical problems that prevent teams from trusting and effectively managing AI agents in production software development.
