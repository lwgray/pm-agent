# Kanban Integration Analysis - Agent 4 Report

## Summary

After thorough investigation of the git history and codebase, I've found that **the real kanban integration is currently active**, not mocked. The mock function exists in the code but is not being used.

## Timeline of Changes

1. **June 16, 2025 (commit 6961af0)** - SimpleMCPKanbanClient was created to fix connection timeout issues with the kanban-mcp server. This implementation uses direct MCP connections and works reliably.

2. **June 26, 2025 (commit 57766ab)** - A mock MCP function caller was added for testing purposes. This added the `_mcp_function_caller` method to marcus_mcp_server.py with mock responses.

3. **June 26, 2025 (commit fea24ed)** - The system was restored to use the original Planka integration via SimpleMCPKanbanClient, removing the mock configuration.

## Current State

### Active Implementation
- **KanbanFactory** creates `PlankaKanbanSimple` for Planka provider
- **PlankaKanbanSimple** uses `SimpleMCPKanbanClient` 
- **SimpleMCPKanbanClient** connects directly to kanban-mcp server at `../kanban-mcp/dist/index.js`
- The connection uses real MCP protocol via stdio

### Mock Code (Not Used)
- `_mcp_function_caller` method exists in marcus_mcp_server.py but is not called
- The mock was intended for testing when kanban-mcp server is not available
- Current implementation bypasses this mock entirely

## How Real Integration Works

```python
# From SimpleMCPKanbanClient
server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="node",
    args=["../kanban-mcp/dist/index.js"],
    env=os.environ.copy()
)

async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        # Makes real MCP calls to kanban server
```

## Configuration Requirements

For the real integration to work:
1. **kanban-mcp** must be installed at `../kanban-mcp/`
2. **Planka** must be running (default: http://localhost:3333)
3. Environment variables must be set:
   - `PLANKA_BASE_URL` (defaults to http://localhost:3333)
   - `PLANKA_AGENT_EMAIL` (defaults to demo@demo.demo)
   - `PLANKA_AGENT_PASSWORD` (defaults to demo)
4. **config_marcus.json** must contain:
   - `board_id`: The Planka board ID
   - `project_id`: The Planka project ID

## Verification

To verify the real integration is working:
1. Check if kanban-mcp server starts when Marcus runs
2. Look for connection logs showing MCP session initialization
3. Monitor Planka UI to see real tasks being created/updated
4. Check for the absence of "MCP Call:" mock logging

## Conclusion

The investigation reveals that Marcus is using the real Planka integration, not mocked data. The mock function exists in the codebase but is dormant. The SimpleMCPKanbanClient successfully connects to the kanban-mcp server and performs real operations on the Planka board.

### Original Implementation Details
The working implementation that was "removed" was never actually removed - it evolved:
1. Initial implementation had connection issues
2. SimpleMCPKanbanClient was created as a more reliable version
3. Mock was temporarily added for testing
4. System was restored to use SimpleMCPKanbanClient
5. Mock code was left in place but unused

The real kanban calls were never permanently removed, just temporarily bypassed during testing.
