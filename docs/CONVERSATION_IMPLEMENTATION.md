# PM Agent Conversation Implementation

This document describes the enhanced conversation logging system for PM Agent that shows detailed interactions between Workers, PM Agent, and the Kanban Board.

## Overview

The conversation system provides complete visibility into:
- Worker ↔ PM Agent communication
- PM Agent ↔ Kanban Board queries and updates
- Internal decision-making processes
- Task assignment logic

## Implementation Components

### 1. Worker MCP Client (`src/worker/mcp_client.py`)

A proper MCP client for workers to connect to PM Agent server:

```python
from src.worker.mcp_client import WorkerMCPClient

# Create client
client = WorkerMCPClient()

# Connect to PM Agent
async with client.connect_to_pm_agent() as session:
    # Register worker
    await client.register_agent(agent_id, name, role, skills)
    
    # Request tasks
    task = await client.request_next_task(agent_id)
    
    # Report progress
    await client.report_task_progress(agent_id, task_id, status, progress, message)
    
    # Report blockers
    await client.report_blocker(agent_id, task_id, description, severity)
```

### 2. Verbose Kanban Client (`src/integrations/mcp_kanban_client_verbose.py`)

Enhanced Kanban client that logs all interactions:

Features:
- Logs all requests to Kanban board
- Shows Kanban processing steps
- Displays responses with formatting
- Visualizes board state

### 3. Mock Workers

#### Basic Mock Worker (`scripts/mock_claude_worker_mcp.py`)
- Connects to PM Agent via MCP
- Simulates realistic worker behavior
- Shows basic communication flow

#### Verbose Mock Worker (`scripts/mock_claude_worker_verbose.py`)
- Detailed conversation logging
- Worker personality traits
- Rich terminal output
- Progress visualization

### 4. Test Scripts

#### Full Conversation Test (`scripts/test_full_conversation.py`)
- Complete three-way conversation simulation
- No external dependencies
- Shows all communication patterns

#### Conversation Visualizer (`scripts/visualize_conversation_flow.py`)
- Generates Mermaid diagrams
- Creates example conversations
- Documents patterns

## Conversation Patterns

### 1. Worker Registration
```
Worker → PM: "I'm Claude Backend Dev with skills: python, api, database"
PM thinks: "New worker, validating skills"
PM → Worker: "Welcome! You're registered"
```

### 2. Task Assignment
```
Worker → PM: "I need work"
PM thinks: "Checking worker skills"
PM → Kanban: "Get available tasks"
Kanban: "Searching Backlog..."
Kanban → PM: "Found 3 tasks"
PM thinks: "Best match is task X"
PM → Kanban: "Assign task X to worker"
Kanban: "Moving to In Progress"
Kanban → PM: "Assignment confirmed"
PM → Worker: "Here's your task"
```

### 3. Progress Updates
```
Worker → PM: "50% complete"
PM → Kanban: "Update progress"
Kanban: "Adding comment, updating %"
Kanban → PM: "Updated"
PM → Worker: "Keep going!"
```

### 4. Blocker Handling
```
Worker → PM: "I'm blocked"
PM thinks: "Analyzing blocker"
PM → Kanban: "Mark blocked"
Kanban: "Adding blocked label"
PM → Worker: "Try these solutions"
```

## Running the Demos

### Prerequisites
1. PM Agent must be running separately:
   ```bash
   python pm_agent_mcp_server.py
   ```

2. Planka should be accessible at http://localhost:3333

### Demo Commands

1. **Test basic conversation flow:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_conversation.py
   ```

2. **Run mock worker with MCP connection:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/mock_claude_worker_mcp.py
   ```

3. **Test full three-way conversation:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_full_conversation.py
   ```

4. **Generate conversation documentation:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/visualize_conversation_flow.py
   ```

Run tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_worker_mcp_client.py -v
```
