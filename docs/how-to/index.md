### Deployment Decision Tree

```
Which deployment method should I use?
â”œâ”€ Need scalability/HA? â†’ Kubernetes
â”œâ”€ Want isolation/consistency? â†’ Docker
â””â”€ Development/debugging? â†’ Python
```

### Time Estimates

| Guide | Time Required | Difficulty |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Troubleshooting | 5-15 min | Easy |
| Docker Deployment | 10-20 min | Medium |
| Python Deployment | 5-15 min | Easy |
| Kubernetes Deployment | 30-45 min | Hard |
| Security Setup | 30-60 min | Medium |

## ðŸŽ¯ Common Tasks

### First Time Setup
1. Start with [Deploy with Docker](deploy-with-docker.md) for the easiest setup
2. Follow [Security Best Practices](security-best-practices.md) before production
3. Keep [Troubleshoot Common Issues](troubleshoot-common-issues.md) handy

### Production Deployment
1. Choose between [Kubernetes](deploy-on-kubernetes.md) or [Docker](deploy-with-docker.md)
2. Implement all [Security Best Practices](security-best-practices.md)
3. Set up monitoring and backups

### Development Setup
1. Use [Deploy with Python](deploy-with-python.md) for local development
2. Enable debug mode for easier troubleshooting
3. Use hot-reload for faster iteration
