# Marcus UI Server - Fixed!

## Status: WORKING ✅

The Marcus Visualization UI is now working and accessible at **http://localhost:8080**

## What Was Fixed

1. **Made `start_monitoring` async** in `health_monitor.py`
2. **Fixed the callback issue** in `ui_server.py` 
3. **Added route setup** before starting the server
4. **Created a proper runner script** at `run_ui_server.py`
5. **Fixed JSON serialization error** in `_decision_analytics_handler` - converted Decision objects to dictionaries
6. **Fixed AI Engine fallback mode** - Added .env loading and corrected model name to `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`

## How to Start the UI

```bash
cd /Users/lwgray/dev/marcus
python run_ui_server.py
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8080**

## Features Available

The UI provides real-time visualization of:
- 📊 Agent conversations
- 🧠 Decision-making processes  
- 🕸️ Knowledge graph
- 💚 System health metrics

## Minor Issues Remaining

There's a health monitor error that appears in logs:
```
Monitoring error: '<=' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'
```

This doesn't prevent the UI from working, it just means health monitoring has a bug.

## Fixed Issues

✅ **JSON Serialization Error** - Previously, the `/api/decisions/analytics` endpoint was failing with:
```
TypeError: Object of type Decision is not JSON serializable
```
This has been fixed by converting Decision objects to dictionaries before returning them in the JSON response.

## For Experiments

You now have two monitoring options:

### Option 1: With UI (Recommended)
1. Start Marcus MCP: `python marcus_mcp_server.py`
2. Start UI: `python run_ui_server.py`
3. Open http://localhost:8080
4. Run experiments and watch real-time updates

### Option 2: Without UI (Still Works)
1. Start Marcus MCP: `python marcus_mcp_server.py`
2. Monitor through:
   - Terminal logs
   - Git commits
   - Kanban board

## Dependencies

If the UI fails to start, install:
```bash
pip install aiohttp aiohttp-cors python-socketio jinja2
```

## Summary

✅ UI Server is now working on port 8080
✅ Can visualize Marcus operations in real-time
✅ Optional - Marcus still works without it
⚠️ Minor health monitor bug (non-critical)
