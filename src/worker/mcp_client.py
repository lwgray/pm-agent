"""
MCP Client for Worker Agents to connect to Marcus Server.

This module provides a comprehensive client implementation for worker agents to
communicate with the Marcus server using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
It handles all aspects of worker-server communication including connection
management, task lifecycle operations, and error recovery.

The client supports:
- Secure MCP connection establishment and management
- Agent registration with role and skill specification
- Task request and assignment handling
- Progress reporting with milestone tracking
- Blocker reporting with severity classification
- Project status monitoring

Classes
-------
WorkerMCPClient
    Main client class for MCP communication with Marcus server

Examples
--------
Basic worker agent workflow:

>>> import asyncio
>>> from src.worker.mcp_client import WorkerMCPClient
>>> 
>>> async def worker_main():
...     client = WorkerMCPClient()
...     async with client.connect_to_marcus() as session:
...         # Register agent
...         result = await client.register_agent(
...             "worker-001", 
...             "Backend Developer", 
...             "Developer", 
...             ["python", "fastapi", "postgresql"]
...         )
...         
...         # Work loop
...         while True:
...             task = await client.request_next_task("worker-001")
...             if not task.get('task'):
...                 break
...                 
...             # Report progress milestones
...             await client.report_task_progress(
...                 "worker-001", task['task']['id'], "in_progress", 25
...             )
...             
...             # Complete task
...             await client.report_task_progress(
...                 "worker-001", task['task']['id'], "completed", 100
...             )
>>> 
>>> asyncio.run(worker_main())

Notes
-----
This client requires the Marcus MCP server to be running and accessible.
All communication is asynchronous and uses the MCP stdio transport protocol.
Workers should handle connection failures gracefully and implement retry logic.

    MCP Client for workers to communicate with Marcus.
    
    This class provides a high-level interface for worker agents to communicate
    with the Marcus server using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It manages
    connection lifecycle, handles all Marcus operations, and provides robust
    error handling and recovery mechanisms.
    
    The client operates asynchronously and maintains a persistent connection
    to the Marcus server through stdio pipes. It supports the full workflow
    of agent registration, task management, progress reporting, and status
    monitoring required for autonomous worker operation.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    session : Optional[ClientSession]
        The active MCP client session, None when disconnected

    -------
    connect_to_marcus()
        Async context manager for establishing MCP connection
    register_agent(agent_id, name, role, skills)
        Register worker agent with Marcus system
    request_next_task(agent_id)
        Request next available task assignment

        Report task blockers to Marcus for AI assistance and resolution.
        
        This method allows agents to report issues that prevent task completion,
        triggering AI-powered analysis and recommendation systems. The Marcus
        can provide suggested solutions, escalate to human oversight, or
        reassign tasks based on blocker severity and type.
        
        Blockers are categorized by severity and analyzed for patterns that
        might indicate systemic issues. The AI analysis engine can suggest
        solutions, alternative approaches, or resource adjustments to resolve
        blockers efficiently.
