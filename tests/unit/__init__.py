"""
Unit tests for PM Agent components.

This package contains unit tests for individual PM Agent components and modules,
testing them in isolation with mocked dependencies.

Notes
-----
Unit tests should be fast, isolated, and not require external services or
network connections. Use mocks and fixtures for external dependencies.
