## Key Testing Strategies Used:

1. **Comprehensive Mocking**: All external dependencies (Kanban client, AI engine, workspace manager, MCP server) are properly mocked
2. **Edge Case Coverage**: Tests cover success paths, error scenarios, and edge cases
3. **Exception Handling**: Every major function has exception handling tests
4. **Fixture Reuse**: Common test data and mocks are defined as fixtures for consistency
5. **Async Testing**: All async methods are properly tested with `pytest.mark.asyncio`
6. **State Management**: Tests verify proper state changes in agent status and task assignments

## Uncovered Lines:
The remaining 25 uncovered lines (12.32%) are primarily:
- MCP decorator registration code (lines 242-303) - these are decorator internals
- Line 123 - part of the tool listing decorator
- Line 827 - uptime calculation edge case
- Line 980 - main function entry point

These uncovered lines are mostly framework integration code that would require integration tests rather than unit tests.

## Test Quality Metrics:
- All tests run in < 100ms (total suite runs in ~0.61s)
- No external dependencies required
- Clear test names following the pattern: test_[what]_[when]_[expected]
- Comprehensive docstrings for each test
- Proper use of Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
