"""
Unit tests for the visualization system.

This package contains unit tests for the PM Agent visualization components,
including the UI server, health monitor, knowledge graph, and real-time
streaming capabilities.

Notes
-----
These tests verify visualization components in isolation, using mocked
data sources and WebSocket connections for testing real-time features.
