"""
Unit tests for PRD Parser module.

This module tests the Product Requirements Document (PRD) parsing capabilities,
including format detection, content extraction, feature analysis, tech stack
identification, and constraint parsing.

Notes
-----
Tests mock all external dependencies to ensure reproducibility and isolation.
All parsing and analysis logic is thoroughly tested with various document formats
and edge cases to achieve 80%+ test coverage.
